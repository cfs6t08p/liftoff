Liftoff is an application for the Fleshlight Launch, to be used in conjunction with [Ignition](https://github.com/cfs6t08p/ignition).

Liftoff aims to be 100% compatible with applications developed for the official 1.3 firmware while not suffering from any of its flaws (no more speed bug!).

Installation
============

**If Ignition has not been installed yet**: follow the instructions for installing [Ignition](https://github.com/cfs6t08p/ignition).

**If Ignition has already been installed**: go to the [Ignition application update tool](https://cfs6t08p.github.io/liftoff.js/update.html) and select the Liftoff .ign file.
